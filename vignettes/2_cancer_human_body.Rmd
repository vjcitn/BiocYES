# Cancer in the human body -- data science concepts of anatomy and cancer subtypes

# An atlas of human cancers: TCGA

![NCI GDC body map](./bodymap.jpg)

- This display highlights the general locations in the
human body that are susceptible to tumor formation

- There are many types of cancers that arise in
blood or bone marrow -- referred to as liquid tumors

- The display is based on a large project undertaken at the National
Cancer Institute to collect _genomic data_ on a wide variety of cancers

TCGA participants with breast cancer.

## Preliminary statistical concepts

- "Survival curves": displaying times to event for a cohort of individuals
    - A time origin is selected, typically time of diagnosis for an individual
    - An individual is observed to die or relapse, or survives longer than the study followup-time
    - In the latter case (no event observed) the event is said to be "censored"

- Estimating the five-year survival probability
- Median survival estimates
- Confidence intervals
